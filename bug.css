The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations on CSS values. However, there is a potential error if the calculation includes a unitless number. For example, the following code will cause an error in some browsers:

```css
.element { width: calc(50% - 10); }
```

The correct way to write this code is to include the unit of measurement in the unitless number:

```css
.element { width: calc(50% - 10px); }
```
This bug can be difficult to track down because it may not always cause an error. In some cases, it may simply result in unexpected behavior.
